    "We have an ASCII file defining every building ground plan as a polygon by listing its vertices. Hence the entry for a given building is the building number followed by the number of vertices of its boundary and the rooftop elevation (assumed flat), followed by a list of the (X,Y) coordinates of each one of the vertices of its boundary. As an example the entry for building number 186 is given below:\n",
    "The sequence means: Building number 186 is a polygon with 4 vertices and its rooftop elevation is 67.5 m (MSL). The (X,Y) co-ordinates of the given 4 vertices follow in the four next lines.\n",
